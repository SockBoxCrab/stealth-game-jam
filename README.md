# Stealth Game Jam
The aim with this project was to quickly create a stealth game in Godot so as to show off my skills, and actually create a functioning video game for once. Unfortunately as college classes are going to start soon, I'm unable to put as much time into it as I was hoping. Work will still be done on this project, but it will be much slower than my previous progress. Hopefully it can still serve as a representation of my programming skills, despite the unfinished nature of the project.

## Planning Document
You can read my thoughts/notes while I am developing this on [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12u8G-UWCU5dTdj_DMAqFxAhvYYngE2nHEc55exBEVUo/edit?usp=sharing). 

## How To Run
First, download Godot 4.3 .NET version from their website: https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.3-stable/ \
Next, download the zip archive of this Github repository

Then you can import this zip file to Godot via this button after opening the Godot executable

This will create a Godot project for you from the files in the zip archive. Default.tscn is my testing scene, so use that to look at how the game "plays". You can run the default scene using this button in the upper right corner:

## Libraries Used
https://github.com/func-godot \
Func_godot was used as a bridge between [Trenchbroom](https://trenchbroom.github.io/) and Godot so that it would be easier to create maps.
