# Stealth Game Jam
The aim with this project was to quickly create a stealth game in Godot so as to show off my skills, and actually create a functioning video game for once. I'm hoping that a short deadline of roughly a week will help force me to finish things rather than leaving this an unfinished project.

## Planning Document
You can read my thoughts/notes while I am developing this on [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12u8G-UWCU5dTdj_DMAqFxAhvYYngE2nHEc55exBEVUo/edit?usp=sharing). 

## How To Run


## Libraries Used
https://github.com/func-godot \
Func_godot was used as a bridge between [Trenchbroom](https://trenchbroom.github.io/) and Godot so that it would be easier to create maps.
