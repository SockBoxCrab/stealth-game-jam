# Stealth Game Jam
The aim with this project was to quickly create a stealth game in Godot so as to show off my skills, and actually create a functioning video game for once. Unfortunately as college classes are going to start soon, I'm unable to put as much time into it as I was hoping. Work will still be done on this project, but it will be much slower than my previous progress. Hopefully it can still serve as a representation of my programming skills, despite the unfinished nature of the project.

## Planning Document
You can read my thoughts/notes while I was developing this on [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12u8G-UWCU5dTdj_DMAqFxAhvYYngE2nHEc55exBEVUo/edit?usp=sharing). 

## How To Run
First, download Godot 4.3 .NET version from their website: https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.3-stable/ \
Next, download the zip archive of this Github repository

Then you can import this zip file to Godot via this button after opening the Godot executable

This will create a Godot project for you from the files in the zip archive. Default.tscn is my testing scene, so use that to look at how the game "plays". You can run the default scene using this button in the upper right corner:

## Libraries Used
https://github.com/func-godot \
Func_godot was used as a bridge between [Trenchbroom](https://trenchbroom.github.io/) and Godot so that it would be easier to create maps.

## Biggest Challenge When Creating Work
Despite having experience with the Godot engine in the past making small prototypes, this project was a bit of a departure from those, mainly due to its use of C# rather than the built-in GDScript langauge. This required a bit of a readjustment for how to program pieces of gameplay since I was used to GDScript's style rather than C#. On top of this, I used a lot of tools in the engine that I had never touched before, such as the Navigation Mesh/Agents system. So a lot of work was put into having to learn these new parts of the engine while still trying to make sure that I created "finished" features that worked how I wanted them to.

## Areas of Focus
While this project may be "unfinished", I hope that you can take into account the short amount of time put into it (roughly 7 days, not counting days where no work was done in between). It should show my ability to quickly develop an idea, especially due to my lack of experience with certain aspects of the engine before starting this project.
